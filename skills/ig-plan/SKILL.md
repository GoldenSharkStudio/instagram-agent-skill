  Use when the user says "plan my week", "what should I post", "content
  calendar", "I have nothing to post about", or wants a posting schedule and a
  list of accounts to engage with. Use quando o usuário diz "planeja minha
  semana", "o que eu posto", "calendário de conteúdo", "não tenho nada pra

# ig-plan

The control room. Everything else in this pack executes; this decides what gets
executed. Run it once a week, on the same day.

<!-- shared:before-you-write -->
## Before you write

The same steps open every ig-* skill.

1. Read `~/.claude/instagram/voice.md` if it exists: who the user is, who they
   talk to, how they sound, what they never say. If it does not exist, ask once
   for three of their own posts (reels, captions or comments) and the language
   they post in (`en`, `pt-BR`, or `auto` for both). Infer the voice from the
   posts, put the language on a line of its own, written exactly
   `- **Language:** pt-BR` (with their code), show the user the file, and write
   `~/.claude/instagram/voice.md` only after they say yes. Never invent a voice.
2. Answer in the language of its **Language:** line: `en` is English, `pt-BR`
   is Brazilian Portuguese. With `auto`, no voice.md or no Language line, answer
   in the language the user writes to you in. These instructions are in English;
   what you write for the user is in their language.
3. `{language}` in a command is that same line: `en`, `pt-BR` or `auto`. With no
   voice.md, or no Language line in it, use `en`. A language whose data is not
   in the skill folder yet is refused with exit 2 and the name of the missing
   file. Tell the user, and run with `--lang en` only if they agree, saying the
   checks are tuned for English.
4. `{skill_dir}` is the folder this SKILL.md was loaded from (Claude Code names
   it as the skill's base directory). Run every script as
   `python3 {skill_dir}/name.py`, never from the current folder, and read every
   file this skill calls "in this folder" from there. If the folder has no
   scripts (this file was pasted on its own), do the checks by hand and say
   they were not run.
5. **Never fabricate.** A number, client, result or quote under the user's
   name comes from what they told you or from the **Proof I can use** section
   of voice.md (**Provas que posso usar** in the pt-BR form), never from you,
   not even as an example. When one is needed and missing, write
   `{{your number}}` in its place and tell the user what to fill.

## Input

If `~/.claude/instagram/swipe.md` and `log.md` exist, read them.
The swipe file is the user's own evidence from `/ig-viral` about which formulas
are landing in their niche right now, and it outranks anything in this file.
The log stops the plan repeating a theme from the last fortnight: read the
`first line` of the last 14 days of lines.

<!-- shared:log-schema -->
One line per item, oldest at the top, newest at the bottom:

```text
- YYYY-MM-DD | type | formula | first line | account
```

- `type`: `reel`, `carousel`, `story` or `comment`.
- `formula`: the hook formula as `#n` from `ig-reel/hooks.json`, or `-` when
  none was used.
- `first line`: the hook or opening line as the user approved it, with any `|`
  written as `/`.
- `account`: the handle it went out on; for a comment, the account commented
  on.

Read a line by splitting on ` | `. Lines that do not have this shape are older
notes: keep them, do not rewrite them.
<!-- /shared:log-schema -->

If they do not exist, ask for four things and write them down:

1. What the user sells, and to whom.
2. The three or four themes they want to be known for.
3. What actually happened this week: a client call, a number, a mistake, a
   thing they built, an argument they had. This is where posts come from.
4. Ten accounts worth being visible to.

## What to post

Four to five posts a week, and at least three of them Reels. Reels are the only
format on Instagram that reliably reaches people who do not follow the account.
Carousels go deep with the people who already do. Stories are daily and are
planned separately.

Mix across the week, never two of the same type back to back:

| type | share | job |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Proof** | 1 per week | something that happened, with a number. Reel. |
| **Teach** | 1 to 2 per week | one thing the viewer can do today. Reel or carousel. |
| **Opinion** | 1 per week | a position that could lose you followers. Reel. |
| **Story** | 1 per fortnight | a scene with a cost. Reel. |
| **Offer** | 1 per fortnight | what you sell, said plainly, no apology. Carousel or stories. |

For each slot give: the theme, the specific angle from what actually happened
this week, the format, and the hook formula number from `ig-reel/hooks.json`.
Not a topic, an angle. "AI" is not a plan. "The proposal we lost because the
draft had an em dash in it" is a Reel.

## When to post

Post when the user's audience is awake and not at work. For most consumer
audiences that is early evening local time; for a business audience, early
morning.

But say this plainly: **the hour matters far less than the first two seconds.**
Instagram will keep showing a Reel for days if it performs, and will bury a
well-timed one that does not. If the user is optimising posting times before
their hooks work, they are polishing the wrong thing, and you should say so.

Anchor times to the audience's timezone, not the user's, if those differ.

## The engagement round, which is not optional

20 minutes a day, before posting, not after. Build a list of 10:

- **5 reach** - accounts with an audience the user wants, where a good comment
  gets seen. Comment early, before the thread is 200 deep.
- **3 peers** - same size, same field. This is the group that reciprocates.
- **2 buyers** - people who could actually buy. Comment for weeks before any
  DM, and never pitch in a comment.

Hand the list to `/ig-comment`.

Save the plan to `~/.claude/instagram/plan.md` so the other skills can read
it, only after the user says yes to it. If a plan.md is already there, say so
in the question: this one replaces it. Nothing is scheduled or posted
anywhere. This is a plan and the user runs it.
